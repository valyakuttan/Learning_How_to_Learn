# chunking the essentials

Chunks are pieces of information tied together by meaning or use.

The chunks are formed by
   - focused undived attention
   - understanding of the basic idea
   - practice to help deepen the patterns

Recalling the things we have learned is a powefull way
to strengthening chunks.

In addition to form chunks we need to know the **big picture**, so that we know when to apply the chunked
information.

Instead of learning by applying the ideas, if we just
go through someone else's solution, we are not learning
. We are just making the **illusion of comptenence**.

**Transfer** is the idea that a chunk you've mastered in one area 
can often help you much more easily learn chunks of information
in different areas that can share surprising commonalities.

Interleave your learning by practicing your choice of
different concepts, approach, and techniques all in one session.

Chunks are very important, but they don't necessarily build 
flexibility, which is also important in becoming an expert with the material you're learning.
 
# Seeing the bigger picture

Most of the neurons in our cortex carry information 
about what is being experienced.

But our brian carry **neuromodulators** which carry 
information about the value and importance of an
experience in the future, not about the actual 
experience.

**Neuromodulators** are chemicals chemicals that 
influence how a neuron responds to other neurons.

Three neuromodulators which are connected to learning
are

  - **Acetylcholine neurons** form neuromodulatory  
    connections to the cortex that are particularly 
    important for focused learning when you are paying 
    close attention.

    Acetylcholine activates circuits that causes 
    **synaptic plasticity** that leads to long term 
    memory.


  - **Dopamine neurons** are part of a large brain 
    system that controls reward learning. Dopamine is 
    released from these neurons when we receive an 
    unexpected reward. Dopamine release also taken 
    into account future rewards, not just the 
    immediate rewards. Dopamine controls our **motivations**.

    Loss of dopamine neurons leads to a lack of 
    motivation and something called **anhedonia**, 
    which is a loss of interest in things that once
    gave you pleasure.
    
    Severe loss of dopamine neurons causes resting 
    tremor, slowness, rigidity, this is called **Parkinson's disease**. Ultimately, it leads to 
    **catatonia**, a complete lack of any movement.


  - **Serotonin** is a third diffuse neuromodulatory 
    system that strongly affects your social life.
    The level of serotonin is also closely linked to 
    risk-taking behavior, with higher risk in lower
    serotonin levels.

The **amygdala** is one of the major centers where cognition and emotion are
effectively integrated. The amygdala is a part of the limbic system which,
together with hippocampus, is involved in processing memory and decision-making
as well as regulating emotional reactions.

## The value of a library of chunks

Chunks can help understand new concepts, since a chunk
is related to other similar chunks.

Sequential thinking where each small step leads 
deliberately towards a solution, involves the focused 
mode.

Intuition on the other hand, often seems to require 
the creative diffuse mode linking of several seemingly 
different focused mode thoughts.

Most difficult problems and concepts are grasped 
through intuition, because these new ideas make a leap 
away from what you're familiar with.

## Einstellung

In this phenomenon, your initial simple thought, an 
idea you already have in mind or a neural pattern 
you've already developed and strengthened, may prevent 
a better idea or solution from being found.  The German word einstellung means mindset.

You have to unlearn your erroneous older ideas orapproaches even 
while you're learning new ones.
