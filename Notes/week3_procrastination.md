# Procrastination and Memory

# 1. Procrastination

It's best to avoid procrastination by applying willpower at only 
one small point--your reaction to a procrastination cue.  This is

don't want to be using it up unnecessarily.

manner when you are performing the habit. It saves energy.

Habit has 4 parts
   - The cue : this triggers the habit

   - The routine : the response the brain is used to fall into when
     it receives a cue. The zombie response can be either harmful
     or harmless.

   - The reward : the pleasure we get from our routine.

   - The belief : habits have power because your belief in them. 


# Process vs Product
  - Process : flow of time and the habits and actions associated 
    with that flow of time.

  - Product : product is an outcome


To prevent procrastination
   - avoid concentrating on product
   - attention should be on building processes
